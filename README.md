DIVE Backend
=================================================
The Data Integration and Visualization Engine (DIVE) is a platform for semi-automatically generating web-based, interactive visualizations of structured data sets. Data visualization is a useful method for understanding complex phenomena, communicating information, and informing inquiry. However, available tools for data visualization are difficult to learn and use, require a priori knowledge of what visualizations to create.

This fork has updated the code to Python 3.8 and includes new dockerfiles. 

Docker composer files for all services (RabbitMQ, Postgres, Flask and nginx) available here: https://github.com/aneesha/dive-docker
